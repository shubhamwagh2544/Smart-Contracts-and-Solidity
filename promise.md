I promise to never use my private key associated with real money in plain text
I will only place PRIVATE KEY in .env file that has only testnet ETH
Even if i store PRIVATE KEY in .env file, i will not expose the .env file
For real money, i will use --interactive or a keystore file with a password once foundry adds up
